# BANCseq_Protocol
Analysis pipeline for the determination of transcription factor binding affinites by BANC-seq

We describe the pre-processing of raw sequencing reads for the target and spike-in genome, read quantification at binding sites and K<sub>d</sub><sup>App</sup> determination from these quantified reads in R for an example experiment, which can be downloaded from [GEO](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE219035), samples GSM5814083 - GSM5814091.

Pre-processed data, ready to use with the [R script](https://github.com/HNeikes/BANCseq_Protocol/blob/main/BANCseq_KdAppDetermination.pdf) for K<sub>d</sub><sup>App</sup> determination is also available in the [Example Data](https://github.com/HNeikes/BANCseq_Protocol/tree/main/Example%20Data) folder.
