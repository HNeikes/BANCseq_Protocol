# BANCseq_Protocol
Analysis pipeline for the determination of transcription factor binding affinites by BANC-seq

We describe the pre-processing of raw sequencing reads for the target and spike-in genome, read quantification at binding sites and K<sub>d</sub><sup>App</sup> determination from these quantified reads in R for an example experiment.
